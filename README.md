# TwilioQuest Workshop Guide

This guide will walk you through using [TwilioQuest](https://twilio.com/quest), Twilio's free to play game, to teach coding and software development concepts in a workshop setting.

## What is TwilioQuest

TwilioQuest is a free roleplaying game for Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Raspberry Pi, built by Twilio. TwilioQuest helps you learn about software development tools and concepts through in-game tutorials and challenges, called Objectives. Players will journey to different destinations in a series of missions, each covering a different topic, skill, or technology.

### Why use TwilioQuest in a workshop

**Quick summary:** TwilioQuest is great for workshops because:

- Batteries included: all of the content is ready to go, you just need to help players through it!
- Fun and engaging: as a game, TwilioQuest is something different and interesting vs the usual tutorial format.
- Progress & incentives: TwilioQuest's XP system helps you keep track of how everyone is doing, or reward high performance.

**Long version:**
As a game, TwilioQuest is a novel and engaging way to learn coding concepts. The challenges in the game, the objectives, are "self-grading", and contain all of the instructions and tutorialization needed for a player to complete them. This makes it great for workshops with self-paced or independent practice portions, as students can progress at their own pace, still progress if they get stuck, and continue after the workshop at home.

As an instructor, using TwilioQuest reduces the amount of preparation to present a workshop. The game can act as your slides, as you guide players around the level, visiting and explaining each objective, and attempting to complete it with them.

TwilioQuest uses in-game XP to track player progress. You can create an event in TwilioQuest (called an Operation) to track XP earned by your players. You can use this to keep an eye on everyone's progress, to help people when they get stuck, or you can use this as an incentive through competitions to earn the most XP in the available time.

### What can you learn and teach with TwilioQuest

TwilioQuest is always growing and adding new content, but right now, here's some of the missions available in the game:

- **Node.js (Javascript)** with the Javascript Test Lab
- **Git & GitHub** with The Forest of Open Source
- **Python** with The Pythonic Temple
- **HTTP and REST APIs** with The API Academy
- **Twilio** with the VR Training.

You can also create your own missions with [TwilioQuest Extensions](https://twilioquest.github.io/extension-docs/).

## Preparing for a workshop

### Installation instructions

The TwilioQuest launcher can be downloaded from the [TwilioQuest site](https://twilio.com/quest). It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and Raspberry Pi (minimum RPi4 with 4GB Ram).

The downloaded application is the TwilioQuest Launcher. Once started, the Launcher will check for the latest version of the TwilioQuest game, and download it. You can change TwilioQuest versions from the launcher by clicking the "more" button.

To save time in the workshop, it is recommended that you instruct students to download the TwilioQuest launcher, and allow it to download the latest TwilioQuest version, ahead of the workshop. See [preparing your students]() for more info.

### Complete the prologue

When you first start the game, you will create your character, watch a cinematic, and then play a short introductory tutorial called The Prologue. The Prologue takes about 20 minutes to complete, and introduces the characters, story, and mechanics of the game. It's recommended you play through this on your first time playing the game.

When using TwilioQuest in a workshop setting, it's important to remember that first-time players will also encounter the cinematic and prologue. To save time in the workshop, it is recommended that you ask students to complete the prologue before the workshop. See [preparing your students]() for more info.

### Choose what you are going to teach

TwilioQuest has many different missions and pieces of content available.
